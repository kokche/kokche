# üí´ About Me:
Hi, I'm an Android Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience. My primary programming languages are Kotlin, Groovy, Bash, and Java.<br>I have experience in almost all modern Android development stacks and APIs, such as various AAC libraries, Jetpack Compose, ExoPlayer, Multi-<br>threading and reactive programming (RxJava, Flow, Coroutines), SQLite, JUnit, Dagger, and memory management, data protection and testing best<br>practices, etc. Over my career, I have also experimented with various mobile app architectures, including MVP, MVI, MVVM, and Redux with advanced<br>modularization and best software engineering practices (BDD, TDD, DDD, Clean Code).<br>Additionally, I have practical experience in building mobile architecture on all levels, i.e., network, infrastructure, security, and persistence. I have also<br>implemented techniques to improve Android applications' performance, designed comprehensive APIs, managed projects from zero to one, managed<br>staff members, hired and trained them, and facilitated their development within the company. I enjoy engaging teams and overcoming technological<br>difficulties.<br>Throughout my career, I've worked in various settings and under time constraints. Many of the apps I've developed, some of which have millions of<br>active users, are in different fields, such as healthcare, financial services, cryptocurrency and health coaching.
